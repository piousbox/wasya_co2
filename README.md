Development
===========

port 3012 please

The rails project only generates the static html. Everything still runs as a static angular site.

Look at the /etc/apache2/sites-available/wasya_co2.conf for the setup for the virtual site.

CI/CD Pipeline
==============

Make sure to install:
* ruby (gems)
* git
* bundler

Otherwise the jenkins job won't run.

INSTALL
=======
 sudo apt-get install php7.0-curl
