Development
===========

port 3012 please

The rails project only generates the static html. Everything still runs as a static angular site.

Look at the /etc/apache2/sites-available/wasya_co2.conf for the setup for the virtual site.

Deploy
======

Make sure to link public_angular/img/icons against ish_lib
